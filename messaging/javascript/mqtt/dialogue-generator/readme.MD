# Diffusion's MQTT Connector 

In this tutorial we are going to go through how to create a **producer** and two **consumers**, using Javascript.

Since it's hard to find anyone who hasn't fallen under the charm of the unique **StarWars** motion pictures, I think it would be a nice treat to go over some of the most iconic episode dialogues (**Episode IV**), and use them to play a bit, and in the meantime, learn how Diffusion integrates MQTT as a Connector, in an efficient and really fast way. It'd be like messages would be *warping* from producer to consumers.
